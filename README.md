# LENS GATED POST WITH BUNDLR/ARWEAVE
The application estimates the cost of your post to upload it on arweave and then posts the content on the lens protocol.
All of this happens in one click ==> Estimate cost of your post and as well as the posting the content.
By using Bundlr you do not have to own the native arweave currency. You only fund the account with matic that is needed for your specific post.
